# Infinity Scroll

This is a simple training app based on HTML, CSS and Javascript.

- Fething the data in JSON format from the [Unsplash Api](https://unsplash.com/documentation/).
- Dynamically inserting the photos into the DOM on initial loading.
- When the user scrolls close to the bottom of the page the app makes another GET request to the API and inserts photos into the DOM (lazy loading).
- Responsive on large and small screens with the help of the CSS media queries.
